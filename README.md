# PreWork_CodePath
I created the HelloWorld App. It has the followin feature:
-A text message introduction of myself and a short description of my goals
-An ImageView widget with the Indian flag in it. This represents my identity.
-A Button that sends a message of "namaste to you too :)" to the user


Thank you!
